# Change Log

## [0.1.5]

- Initial release

## [0.2.0]

- Added autocompletion for functions in the Functions Library defined by the user (note: `CfgFunctions.hpp` needs to be generated at least once after opening the editor for the autocompletion to work)

## [0.3.0]

- Added an option/task to generate `CfgRemoteExec.hpp` template based on the `CfgFunctions.hpp`
  - Note that you must generate the `CfgFunctions.hpp` at least once and make sure that the file is active by clicking on it in the editor view before you can run the `Generate CfgRemoteExec template (Arma 3)` task. (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P`)
